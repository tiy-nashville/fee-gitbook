## Github - 20 Mins

Github is important to understand and we'll be using it to turn in assignments.
So let's get started by turning in your first assignment.
But, before you get started, check out this video from github on how to create new issues: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJlYiMp8FuY *NOTE* Some of the UI for filtering has moved from the left hand side to above the issues list but most of the issue creation process has been left the same.

Go to the assignment repo for this class and do the following:


* **https://github.com/tiy-nashville/fee-gitbook**

* Add a bookmark to the assignment repo in your bookmark bar
* Click on the issues link to the right
* Make a new issue titled <Your Name> - 00 - Introduction

In your issue, include:

* Your Name
* Your Github Username
* Answers to the below questions:

1. What difficulties do you predict that you will encounter during our course? How have you reacted to similar situations in the past? How do you plan on reacting to these situations during the class?
2. Which part of the prework did you like the MOST? Which part of the prework did you like the LEAST? If you found any of the prework confusing, please explain.

> Notice that Github uses a note taking language called Markdown that compiles into HTML (it's actually the same format I use to make this Gitbook too).
> You should read up on these two articles from [Team Treehouse](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/explaining-markdown) and [Github](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and use some markdown formatting in your issue.

## A Quick Video

In our lives (especially during busy times), we are bombarded with choices that can use a lot of our energy without even knowing it!
But, we can combat this if we are aware of it.
Here is a video from TED that talks about the Paradox of Choice and what it means for our lives.
