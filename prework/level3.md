# Level 3

Most of this level reviews past concepts using content and videos from Team Treehouse.
If you already have an account to Codeschool, look at the content from [Level 4](./level4.html) as that will have links to videos on that site.
If you are a member of another tutorial site let me know and I can help guide you to relevant content if it is available and up to date.

If you don't feel like the format of Treehouse is working, try to stick it out until the end of the lesson.
If it's still not feeling right, you may want to give the Codeschool videos (they almost perfectly match those here) a try by looking at the links in [Level 4](./level4.html).

## HTML & CSS (Treehouse How to Make a Website) - 5-8 Hours

This course of videos and exercises will walk you through creating a website using HTML and CSS.
By now much of this will feel like review, but this course has some extra knowledge to add to Codecademy or Codeschool materials.

## Javascript (Treehouse JS Basics) - 2-4 Hours

This course covers basic variables, logic, and function expressions.
This will work on review from your work on Codecademy and Newline.

## More Review

From here, you are ready to look back over some of the [projects](projects.html).
If you still have time, look through the [Front End Development Track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development) from Team Treehouse and see if there are any topics you feel like you need to review.
At this point, you have made awesome progress to being ready for class.

Also, update your issue from Lesson 2 to let me know how far you got in your prework.
